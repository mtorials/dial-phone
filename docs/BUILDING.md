# Building

The library relies on packages hosted on GitHub. Because of this you have to specify your GitHub username and
a personal access token (with scope `read:packages`) as environment variables.

```
GH_USER=<your_username>
GH_TOKEN=<your_token>
```

## Testing

To run integration tests you need to have docker-compose installed.
