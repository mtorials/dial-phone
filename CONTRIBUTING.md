# Contributing

Everyone is welcome to contribute! Just take a look at the issues tap for a topic to work on.
If you want to add features please open an issue first to discuss the new feature.
You can also just open a pull request but then I might reject the code.

## Coding style

Just use the normal koltin [conding conventions](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coding-conventions.html).
I do not perfectly follow them either, so just try to write readable code.
